### Problem Description
+ Get all unique `ShipNames` from the Order table that contain a hyphen `'-'` 
+ **Details**: In addition, get all the characters preceding the (first) hyphen. Return ship
names alphabetically. Your first row should look like `Bottom-Dollar Markets|Bottom`

## q3

### Problem Description

+ Indicate if an order's `ShipCountry` is in North America. For our purposes, this
  is `'USA', 'Mexico', 'Canada'`
+ **Details**: You should print the Order `Id` , `ShipCountry` , and another column that is
  either `'NorthAmerica'` or `'OtherPlace'` depending on the Ship Country.
  Order by the primary key ( `Id` ) ascending and return 20 rows starting from Order
  `Id` `15445` Your output should look
  like `15445|France|OtherPlace` or `15454|Canada|NorthAmerica`

### Code

```sql
SELECT Id || '|' || ShipCountry || '|' ||
CASE
    WHEN ShipCountry IN ('USA', 'Mexico', 'Canada') THEN 'NorthAmerica'
    ELSE 'OtherPlace'
END AS CountryInfo
FROM "Order"
WHERE Id >=15445
ORDER BY Id;
```

+ **Details**: An order is considered late if ShippedDate > RequiredDate . Print the
  following format, order by descending percentage, rounded to the nearest
  hundredths, like United Package|23.44

### Code

       ROUND((CAST(Delay AS FLOAT) * 100 / CAST(Total AS FLOAT)) ,2) AS PerDelay
FROM
    (SELECT  S.Id, S.CompanyName, COUNT(*) AS Delay
    FROM Shipper S, "Order" O
    WHERE S.Id = O.ShipVia AND O.ShippedDate > O.RequiredDate
    GROUP BY S.Id) Delay
    ,
    (SELECT  S.Id, S.CompanyName, COUNT(*) AS Total
    FROM Shipper S, "Order" O
    WHERE S.Id = O.ShipVia
    GROUP BY S.Id) Total
WHERE Delay.Id = Total.Id
ORDER BY PerDelay DESC
```

SELECT CategoryName || '|' ||
       COUNT(*) || '|' ||
       round(AVG(UnitPrice), 2) || '|' ||
       MIN(UnitPrice) || '|' ||
       MAX(UnitPrice) || '|' ||
       SUM(UnitsOnOrder) AS Q5
FROM Product, Category
WHERE Product.CategoryId = Category.Id
GROUP BY CategoryId
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY CategoryId
```

### Result

## q6

### Problem Description

+ For each of the 8 discontinued products in the database, which customer made the
  first ever order for the product? Output the
  customer's `CompanyName` and `ContactName`
+ **Details**: Print the following format, order by `ProductName` alphabetically: `Alice
  Mutton|Consolidated Holdings|Elizabeth Brown`

### Code

## q7

### Problem Description

+ For the first 10 orders by `CutomerId BLONP` : get the Order's `Id` , `OrderDate` ,
  previous `OrderDate` , and difference between the previous and current. Return
  results ordered by `OrderDate` (ascending)
+ **Details**: The "previous" `OrderDate` for the first order should default to itself (lag
  time = 0). Use the `julianday()` function for date arithmetic (example).
  Use lag(expr, offset, default) for grabbing previous dates.
  Please round the lag time to the nearest hundredth, formatted like `17361|2012-09-
  19 12:13:21|2012-09-18 22:37:15|0.57`


### Code

```sql

        WITH cte_BLONP AS (
            SELECT Id, OrderDate
            FROM "Order"
            WHERE "Order".CustomerId = 'BLONP'
            ORDER BY OrderDate
            LIMIT 10
        )

        FROM cte_BLONP
    )

    SELECT Id, OrderDate,
           CASE
               WHEN Rank=1 THEN OrderDate
               ELSE Temp
               END AS PreOrderDate
    FROM cte
